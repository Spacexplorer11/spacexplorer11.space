# What is this?

This is my second portfolio website, built with svelte, bun, and tailwindcss.  
I also have https://akaalroop.com!

## This vs akaalroop.com?

You: Why on earth does this guy have 2 portfolios?  
Me: I get that, but akaalroop.com's a bit silly and doesn't give much info on how to contact me, what I do, etc etc.  
This portfolio is more professional and detailed, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience in a clearer way.  
You: Why not just make akaalroop.com in this way?  
Me: I wanna have a fun and silly site too yk?  
You: Whatever, idrc

## How to run locally?

Question 1... this is my portfolio, why on earth do you need to...  
Well, I'm hoping you're just trying to add to it, and want to test it out locally before pushing changes.  
So after you've cloned run `bash bun install` to install dependencies, run `bun dev` to start the development server, and open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` to view it.
